&nbsp &nbsp  HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE <br>	<br>	
<p>	
Shri. Shivaji Vidya Prasarak Sanstha’s Bhausaheb N.S. Patil Arts and Mulla Fidaali Mulla Abadulali Commerce College, Dhule, was established in June 1956 with a modest sterngth of about 100 students. Initially it was only an intermediate college of Arts faculty. S.S.V.P.Sanstha is the first of its kind in the entire region of Khandesh, established in the 1912 by a devoted and dedicated group of persons for imparting education to the weaker sections of the society at affordable price and place. Dhule district is primarily a trible district of Maharashtra which has been lagging much behind other districts in various fields in respect of progress. Right from the inception of S.S.V.P Sanstha, it had been a long cherished dream and sincere wish of our founding fathers that the students belonging to agrarian community and other weaker section of the society of Dhule district should get an opportunity to pursue their higher education in their district itself. At that time it was a sort of prerogative of the very few of the elite because higher education was available only at far off places like Bombay, Pune and Nasik. This was even well beyond the reach of the rich! Thus many a student from poor classes had to stop his education after Matriculation. Our Sanstha had been doing a yeoman’s service in the field of education since 1912 by opening a boarding house for poor and needy students and middle schools in later years. After having rendered such a selfless service to the society for four decades the golden moment of realizing the goal came in the history of our Sanstha in June 1956 .

On 2 June 1956 SSVP Sanstha’s Arts College was formally opened in the auspicious presence of the first Senior Wrangler of Maharashtra and the Vice Chancellor of the University of Pune, Dr.R.P Paranjpe. This occasion by distinguished scholar Dr.R.P.Paranjape spelled and ensured a steady and rapid growth of our Sanstha . From June 1957 Science wing was started for inter classes and in June 1958 Commerce faculty was opened.

Now with the passage of time the basic needs like building, permanent structures to accommodate increasing number of students also increased. To meet this need our sanstha started construction of Main Building. Here again the Sanstha added a new feather in its cap by inviting the Finance Minister of India and the Chairman of U.G.C Dr.C.D.Deshmukh to lay the foundation Stone of this building. Thus it is a matter of great person of national stature had been the well-wishers, patrons and visitors not only in the initial stages but also in later formative years.
In 1960 a post-graduate course in Marathi was introduced and this was also the first of its kind in our district. Thus gradually SSVP Sanstha went on making rapid and impressive strides and can legitimately take pride in its varied achievements in the fields of curriculum and cocurricular activities.
